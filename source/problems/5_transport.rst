How does the neutron distribution depend on space?
==================================================

In the last section we characterized the neutron *spectrum*.  We saw that the neutron distribution in energy varied roughly with the fission spectrum at high energies, followed a :math:`1/E` shape through the resonance region (asymptotically, at least), then setteld down into a thermal spectrum resembling the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution.  Within the resonance region, of course, the :math:`1/E` shape was punctuated by sharp dips corresponding to the location of resonances.

All of that, however, was for a system that was initfinitely large and homogeneous.  What if we begin to consider the more realstic case in which materials vary as you move in and out of fuel, clad and cooling regions.  That is,

    How can determine the spatial variation of the neutron flux?

It turns out that considering "space" means also considering direction and, of course, energy.  The emphasis here, however, will be on deriving a neutron balance equation (the transport equation) in which the energy variable takes a momentary back seat.  Transport theory deals principally with following neutrons around as they collide and flow through a medium.  This problem can become quite large and complex very quickly.  We will look at the theoretical basis for neutron transport in a multiplying (i.e., fissioning) medium, some numerical approaches to solving the problem, and approximations that simplify the problem.
