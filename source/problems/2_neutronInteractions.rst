How do neutrons interact with matter?
=====================================

We have established that the fundamental problem in reactor physics is to determine the neutron distrbution in a reactor.  Before we can address this problem, however, we must understand fundamentally how neutrons interact with matter.  Thus our second problem is "simply":

    How do neutrons interact with matter?

Comrehension Assessment
-----------------------

1. In the formation of a compound nucleus, why is the available energy equal to :math:`e_\text{exc}`, the energy in the CM system, rather than the total kinetic energy in the LAB system?
2. Show that conservation of linear momentum in the LAB system implies conservation of linear momentum in the CM system.
3. Show that conservation of energy in the LAB system implies conservation of energy in the CM system.
