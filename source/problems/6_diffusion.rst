How can we simplify neutron transport?
======================================

We have seen that neutron transport can quickly become a very intimidating problem because of the relatively high dimensionality of the phase space.  We should therefore consider the following problem:

    How can we simplify the neutron transport problem?

In other words, we wish to obtain essentially the same information (the neutron distribution), but we are willing to make some approximation if that approximation leads to a substantially simpler problem.
