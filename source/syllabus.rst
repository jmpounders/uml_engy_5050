You are welcome to stop by my office anytime if you have questions, need some help, or just want to chat.  I suggest calling or emailing first, just to make sure I am in my office.  My office is in the 301 office suite, at the top of the main Pinanski stairwell.  My office is all the way in the back of the suite.  (If the suite door is locked it means no one is home!)

Your feedback is encouraged at any time throughout the course. If you are struggling with the pace of the class (too fast or too slow), the texts, the technical concepts, the presentation style, software, etc., please let me know in person, by phone or by email. I want all of you to be able to succeed in this class.

Upon completion of the course, a formal student questionnaire will be given. This will be your opportunity to provide feedback concerning your overall experience in the class, your success in meeting the course objectives, and general suggestions so that I can improve the quality of this course.
