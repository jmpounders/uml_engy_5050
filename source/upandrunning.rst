Up and Running
==============

Throughout the course we will use various computer-based tools to as an aid to solving problems.  Most of the tools are written in some combination of Fortran, C++, and Python, with numerous support libraries.  Trying to get everyone up and running with a system that works on various operating systems is a headache I want to avoid.  Therefore, I have packaged all the computational tools that will be needed in this course into a virual environment.  Once it is setup on your computer, most of your interaction with the virtual environment will be through a simple web application.

Installation of this virtual environment should be straight-forward, but expect to spend an hour or two to get everything downloaded and installed initially.  Once everything is installed, you will probably need another hour or so to play around and make sure you can operate successfully in this environment.

Installation
------------

- Install VirtualBox.
- Install Vagrant.
- Download the Vagrantfile.
- vagrant up

Using the System
----------------
  
- Start the jupyter session
- Save/locate files

Shutting Down
-------------
  
- Shutdown jupyter
- vagrant halt

Uninstalling
------------
  
- vagrant destroy
