How do neutrons interact with matter?
=====================================

We have established that the fundamental problem in reactor physics is to determine the neutron distrbution in a reactor.  Before we can address this problem, however, we must understand fundamentally how neutrons interact with matter.  Thus our second problem is "simply":
