How does the neutron population depend on energy?
=================================================

The last problem showed us that we can characterize neutron interactions through cross sections.  Because of nuclear structure, cross sections can exhibit complex behavior in the resolved resonance energy range.  We migh suspect that this complex cross section behaviour could impact the neutron distribution in equally complex ways.

Thus our next problem will be to answer this question:

    What does the neutron distribution look like with respect to energy?

The actual neutron distribution in a reactor will be a function of space, time, energy, and direction, but presently we will focus only on energy.
