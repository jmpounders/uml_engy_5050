Jupyter Test Notebook
=====================

Once you have your VM setup (see :doc:`upandrunning`), try recreating the Jupyter notebook shown :download:`here <demo_nb.html>` to make sure everything is working properly.  Note that once you enter code in a notebook cell, you need to press ``Shift+Enter`` to evaluate it and move to the next cell.

As an additional test, create a new code cell and enter the two lines ``import pyne`` and ``import pinspec``, followed by ``Shift+Enter``.  You won't see anything happen, but these lines will verify that third-party support software was correctly installed in the VM.

- Is your notebook free of errors and warnings?
- Can you reproduce the sine plot?
- Can you name the notebook by clicking on the title?
- Can you close and re-open the notebook within Jupyter?
- Can you locate the notebook file on your home operating system?

If the answer to all of the above questions is "yes," then congratulations: the *tedious* part of configuration and testing is over, now it's time start the *hard* part of learning reactor physics!
