:Office hours:  By appointment

You are welcome to stop by my office anytime if you have questions, need some help, or just want to chat.  I suggest calling or emailing first, just to make sure I am in my office.  My office is in the 301 office suite, at the top of the main Pinanski stairwell.  My office is all the way in the back of the suite.  (If the suite door is locked it means no one is home!)

See this `short video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQq1-_ujXrM>`_ for what "office hours" can do for you (and possible side effects).

Course Description

Prerequisites
-------------

By taking this course, I assume that you have some prior exposure to basic radiation science, reactor theory,  differential equation, and basic numerical methods, presumably all at the undergraduate level.  I will provide only *brief* reviews of the relevant information from these areas where appropriate.

Throughout the course we will use computational software to look at data and solve certain problems.  Most of this work will be done using the Python programming language, although prior exposure to Python is *not* required.  Our use of Python will be rather superficial, and the required skills will be developed as we go along.  That being said, some prior experience of solving engineering and mathematics problems using a computer (with Matlab, for example) is expected.

Assessments and Grading
-----------------------

The graded assessments for this course will consist of homework assignments and projects.

Feedback
--------

Your feedback is encouraged at any time throughout the course. If you are struggling with the pace of the class (too fast or too slow), the texts, the technical concepts, the presentation style, software, etc., please let me know in person, by phone or by email. I want all of you to be able to succeed in this class.

Upon completion of the course, a formal student questionnaire will be given. This will be your opportunity to provide feedback concerning your overall experience in the class, your success in meeting the course objectives, and general suggestions so that I can improve the quality of this course.
