Project Specification
---------------------

In this final project you will form groups of two to three to study an aspect of reactor physics that we have not explicitly discussed in class.  The possible topics are listed below.

1. Generalized equivalence theory,
2. Fuel depletion,
3. Reactor perturbation theory,
4. Point kinetics,
5. Method of characteristics (transport theory),
6. Monte Carlo methods (transport theory).

*UPDATE:*

- Fuel depletion: Abhishek, Chelsea, Randall
  
  - Things to consider:

    - Burnup equations
    - Uranium (fuel) burn-up
    - Plutonium buildup
    - Fission product poisoining
    - Breeding and conversion
    - Uranium vs. thorium fuel cycles

  - Reference:

    - :download:`Exceprt from Stacey, *Nuclear Reactor Physics* <../_static/FuelBurnup.pdf>`
  
- Monte Carlo: Danielle, Dylan, Jim, Schayne

  - Things to consider:

    - How to "track" neutrons (probabilistically)
    - How to gain meaningful results (statistically)
    - Pros and cons of Monte Carlo
    - Cross section data
    - How to represent geometry
    - How to "optimize" Monte Carlo

  - Reference:

    - :download:`Exceprt from Lewis and Miller, *Computational Methods of Neutron Transport* <../_static/MonteCarlo.pdf>`

The project will consist of the following components.

1. *Group-study:* You and your group members should study the topic thoroughly so that you understand (a) what the underlying problem is and (b) how your topic solves that problem.
2. *Faculty check-in:* Once you feel that you have a reasonable grasp of the content, you should set up an appointment to chat with me for feedback and suggestions.
3. *Numerical Demonstration:* You and your group should devise some numerical demonstration of the topic you are studying.  You can use any combination of hand and computer-assisted calculations that you like.
4. *Written report:* You and your group will collaboratively author a document describing what you have learned and submit it for review by another group.  You will have a chance to respond and revise your document.  Once revised, your document will be posted on the web-site.
5. *Class presentation:* You and your group will share what you have learned with the class.

Timeline
--------

- 4/6: Topic assignment
- 4/20: Meet with me *before* this date for comments and guidance.
- 4/25: Bring hard-copy report to class for review.
- 5/6 (tentative): Presentations

Documentation Guidelines
------------------------

- Each *group* should prepare a single document.
- Use the provided :download:`template <project3/template.docx>`.
- Each document should contain the following elements:
  
  - **Introduction and Background:** What is the significance of understanding this concept?  Why is it important to Reactor Physics?
  - **Theory:** What equations, formulas, methods, and assumptions are used to obtain the results?
  - **Numerical Demonstration:** What you did, plots, tables, graphics, etc. *and* discussion.
  - **Summary:** What is the main take-away from this topic?

- The report should be neat, well-organized, and appropriately styled, i.e., follow the basic rules of manuscript writing:

  - label tables/figures;
  - reference all tables/figures explicitly from the text;
  - use clear, concise language, avoiding fluff and flower;
  - number equations consistently.


   
Presentation Guidelines
-----------------------
   
- The presentations will take place during the final exam period.
- Each presentation should take about 40 minutes.
- Each member of the group must participate in the presentation.
- You may use whatever media you like for the presentation (slides, white board, computer, etc.).
